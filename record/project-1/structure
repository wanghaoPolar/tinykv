The `gRPC` server is initialized in `kv/main.go`
it contains a `tinykv.Server` which provides a `gRPC` service named `TinyKv`.

It was defined by [protocol-buffer](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) in `proto/proto/tinykvpb.proto`
and the detail of rpc requests and responses are defined in `proto/proto/kvrpc.proto`.

you can modify the proto file and run `make proto` to update related generated go code in `proto/pkg/xxx.pb.go`

`Server` depends on a `Storage`
`Storage` is an interface you need to implement for the standalone storage engine located in `kv/storage/standalone_storage/standalone_storage.go`.
Once the interface `Storage` is implemented in `StandaloneStorage`, you could implement the raw key/value service for the `Server` with it.
